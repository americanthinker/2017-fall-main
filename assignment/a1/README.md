# Assignment 1: Information Theory and TensorFlow

## Due: September 14, 2017 11:59 PM Pacific

This assignment consists of two unrelated parts:

* [Infomation Theory Review](information_theory.ipynb)
* [TensorFlow Introduction](tensorflow/fun_with_tensorflow.ipynb)

While we're releasing them at the same time, we strongly recommend that you do that [Assignment 0](../a0/) first to verify that you're all set up with IPython and TensorFlow.

**Hint:** James will be going through Assignment 1 in the extra office hour in Week 2 (September 6 2017 at 7pm). Please come with your questions!

The **Information Theory** notebook is designed to be self-contained and not depend on the async or readings. The async, however, will reference a number of concepts from this notebook - so we hope that it serves as useful background! If you would like to consult additional resources as you complete the Information Theory assignment, we recommend the short reading [Information Theory For Intelligent People](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~simon/it.pdf) and the Santa Fe Institute's free online course [Introduction to Information Theory](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/tutorials/55-introduction-to-information-theory). For those with a special interest in the topic, Claude Shannon's 1948 paper "[A Mathematical Theory of Communication](http://lanethames.com/dataStore/ECE/InfoTheory/shannon.pdf)" laid the foundations for the discipline.

We anticipate you will spend most of your time on the **TensorFlow** introduction.
TensorFlow is a somewhat different programming model than you may be used to. 
Similar to MapReduce, it breaks constructing the computational graph and executing it into two separate steps. 
Some students describe this introduction as the hardest 10 lines of code they've had to write - but we promise that it gets a *lot* easier from there!
